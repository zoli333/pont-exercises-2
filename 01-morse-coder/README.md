First project console application for Morse code

This code can be encode text, words etc.. to Morse code
and decode from Morse code to uppercased text.

The input format does not matter that is it uppercased or lowercased, the
code will always use the uppercased version.

Added also test case for decoding at the test2 function

To run the tests:
	
	mvn compile test
